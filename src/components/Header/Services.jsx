                </h3>
                <p className="mb-4 leading-7">Augmented intelligence is a human-centered partnership model of people and AI working together to enhance cognitive performance. It focuses on AI's assistive role in advancing human capabilities.</p>
                <p className="leading-7">AI interacting with people and improving what they already know reduces mistakes and routine work, and can improve customer interactions, citizen services and patient care.</p>

                <p className="leading-7">To develop AI governance, data and analytics leaders and CIOs should focus on three areas: trust, transparency and diversity to ensure successful AI adoption.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-7">Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries around the world, and has the potential to radically alter the field of healthcare. Imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic, medications prescribed, lab tests, and procedures performed, as well as data outside the health system -- such as social media, purchases made using credit cards, census records, Internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information. We are building systems and multiple innovative products in Healthcare domain.</p>

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-7">Enterprise blockchains today take a practical approach and implement only some of the elements of a complete blockchain by making the ledger independent of individual applications and participants and replicating the ledger across a distributed network to create an authoritative record of significant events. Everyone with permissioned access sees the same information, and integration is simplified by having a single shared blockchain.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-7">In the future, true blockchain or "blockchain complete" will have the potential to transform industries, and eventually the economy, as complementary technologies such as AI and the IoT begin to integrate alongside blockchain. This expands the type of participants to include machines, which will be able to exchange a variety of assets â€” from money to real estate.</p>
